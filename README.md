## 🌟 Overview

Password Monster is a web-based password strength checker inspired by the classic Password Monster tool. Instead of boring security warnings, it features a cartoon monster that evolves as you create stronger passwords - growing from a weak, small creature to a powerful, glowing beast!

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Monster Evolution**: Watch the monster grow and change colors based on password strength
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant feedback as you type with strength levels from Weak to Excellent
- **Educational Content**: Built-in tips and examples for creating secure passwords
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Show/hide password with eye icon
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Client-side Security**: All processing happens in your browser - no data sent to servers

## 🎯 Password Strength Levels

- **Weak** 🔴: Small red monster
- **Fair** 🟡: Normal yellow monster
- **Good** 🟢: Larger green monster with glow
- **Strong** 🔵: Even larger blue monster
- **Excellent** 💙: Biggest blue monster with strong glow and enhanced features

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3**: Custom animations, responsive design, dark theme
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Real-time password analysis and DOM manipulation
- **Git**: Version control and deployment
